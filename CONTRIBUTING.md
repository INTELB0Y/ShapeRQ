# CONTRIBUTORS

## First of all — thanks.

If you're contributing to this project — you're already doing something great. Whether it's a bugfix, a feature, or just cleaning up something — we see you, and we appreciate it.

If something you've written gets merged — awesome. You're part of the story now.  
If that happens more than once — you're not just a contributor, you're part of the team.

## Want to add a feature?

Cool. Do it.

But here's the deal:  
**If you're adding something — you write the docs for it.**  
No one here is gonna do that for you. You built it? You explain it.

Half-baked features with zero documentation are a no-go. If we can't understand what it is or how it's supposed to work, it won't get merged.

## TL;DR

- Thanks for contributing — it really matters.
- Get something merged? You're awesome.
- Do it multiple times? You're part of the team.
- Adding features? Write the docs yourself. No exceptions.

You're building the future of this project. Own your part of it.
